# Basic info
PeerSend is a simple file-transfer program written in Python, using the PySimpleGUI framework. The program *should* support any file-size, but I have not extensibly tested it.

Currently the program does not work entirely as intended, as a single wrongful action causes the program to crash and UI do not update in the way I want.
